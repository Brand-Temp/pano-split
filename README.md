# PANO SPLIT
*Brandon Temple - 20181227*  

I made this little console app to split panorama photos into squares (or square-ish shapes) so I can post them to instagram as a slideshow after realising all the apps that existed were either:
* paid
* watermarked your images
* bad

## To Use:
`python pano-split.py [address of image to split] [number of images to split to]`
